# Sudoku Solver 🧩

This project implements a generalized **Sudoku Solver** using the **backtracking algorithm**. The notebook takes any valid 9x9 Sudoku grid as input (with 0s or blanks representing empty cells) and fills in the missing numbers to complete the puzzle.

## 🔍 About the Project

Sudoku is a popular logic-based puzzle that challenges players to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, row, and 3×3 subgrid contains all digits from 1 to 9 exactly once.  
This solver uses recursive backtracking to explore all valid configurations and find the correct solution.

## 🛠️ Features

- Accepts any valid Sudoku input grid
- Uses efficient backtracking algorithm
- Handles incomplete and partially filled puzzles
- Outputs solved grid (if solvable)

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository or upload the notebook to Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Provide a 9x9 grid as input (use 0s for empty cells).
3. Run the notebook to solve the puzzle.
